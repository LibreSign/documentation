.. LibreSign Main Documentation

Welcome to LibreSign documentation
==================================

Welcome to the LibreSign documentation â€” a digital signature solution developed entirely with free and open-source software by a technology cooperative. This project aims to provide a secure, accessible, and transparent platform for digital document authentication and validation.

This documentation is organized into sections tailored for different audiences:

- `User manual </user_manual/>`_ : instructions on how to use the system.
- `Developer manual </developer_manual/>`_ : technical guides, APIs, and contribution guidelines.
- `Admin manual </admin_manual/>`_ : guidance for installing, configuring, and maintaining the platform.


Reporting Documentation Bugs & How to Contribute
================================================

If you find an error or omission in any of the manuals, we welcome your bug reports and contributions. Contribution to the documentation is very easy as the code is entirely `on GitHub and can be edited there online <https://github.com/LibreSign/documentation/>`_.

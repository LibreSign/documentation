Reporting bugs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reporting bugs in LibreSign is essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of the application.  
If you encounter a bug, please follow these steps to report it effectively:

1. Access the LibreSign repository on GitHub:  

   `https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign <https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign>`__

2. Navigate to the **Issues** section.

3. Before creating a new issue, use the search to check if the problem has already been reported.

4. If no existing issue matches your problem, open a new **Bug report**.

5. Provide clear and detailed information, including:

   - How to reproduce the problem (step by step).  
   - What you expected to happen.  
   - What actually happened.  
   - The environment where the issue occurred (system, browser, LibreSign version, etc.).  
   - Any additional material that may help, such as logs, error messages, screenshots, or even a screen recording of the issue in action.  

6. Submit the issue. You will be automatically subscribed to updates and may be asked for further details.
7. If you have a solution or a patch, you can also submit a pull request with the fix.

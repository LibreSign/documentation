Requesting features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To request a new feature in LibreSign, you can open an issue in the repository. Provide a clear description of the feature you would like to see, including any relevant details or use cases. This helps the development team understand the request and prioritize it accordingly.

When submitting a feature request, consider the following:
- Be specific about the feature you want.
- Explain why the feature is important or how it will benefit users.
- Provide examples or use cases if possible.
- Check if a similar feature request already exists to avoid duplicates.

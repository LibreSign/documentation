Release process
===============

Version numbers
---------------

- The version number follows **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**.
- ``MAJOR`` aligns with the supported Nextcloud Server version (see :ref:`supported-nextcloud-versions`).
- ``MINOR`` is used for LibreSign feature releases.
- ``PATCH`` is used for bug fixes or small improvements.

Stable branches
---------------

Each **stable branch** in LibreSign corresponds to a specific Nextcloud **MAJOR** version.  
For example: ``stable21`` is compatible with Nextcloud 21.

Release checklist
-----------------

A new release starts by creating a GitHub issue with one of the following titles:

.. code-block:: plain

    ðŸš€ Release todo v20.1.9
    ðŸš€ Release todo v20.1.9 and v20.1.8

In the body, paste and adapt the following template. Replace placeholders
with the correct values as you progress through the steps.

.. code-block:: markdown

    <!-- 1. Replace "20.1.9" with the version number e.g. "12.2.4" -->
    <!-- Replace "20.1.8" with the previous version number e.g. "12.2.3" -->
    <!-- 2. Replace "stable30" with the LibreSign minor branch name e.g. "stable22" -->

    - [ ] Check all milestones don't have priority issues still open
        <!-- Add above the link of stables that will be involved in this release process -->
        <!-- Get branches/versions to release from https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/milestones -->
        - [ ] https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/milestone/<!-- put here the milestone ID e.g. 318 -->
        - [ ] https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/milestone/<!-- put here the milestone ID e.g. 319 -->
    - [ ] Check there are no important PRs open against the branch
        <!-- Add above the link with correct base branch of stables that will be involved in this release process -->
        <!-- Get branches/versions to release from https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/milestones -->
        - [ ] https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+base%3Astable30

        -->
    - [ ] Create a PR against main branch at the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the changelog of all milestones that are subject to the release. Look the pattern used in the file and follow it.

        -->
        - [ ] <!-- Add link to PR here -->
    - [ ] Merge the PR
    <!-- Duplicate the follow steps for each version that will be released, starting with the oldest version. -->

    <!-- Replace "XX" with the Nextcloud stable branch number e.g. "22" for "stable22" -->
    <!-- 1. Replace "20.1.9" with the version number e.g. "12.2.4" -->
    <!-- Replace "20.1.8" with the previous version number e.g. "12.2.3" -->
